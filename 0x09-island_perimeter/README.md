For the “0. Island Perimeter” project, you will need to apply your knowledge of algorithms, data structures (specifically matrices or 2D lists), and iterative or conditional logic to solve a geometric problem within a grid context. The goal is to calculate the perimeter of a single island in a grid, where the grid is represented by a 2D array of integers. Understanding how to navigate and analyze 2D arrays and apply logical operations to determine the conditions for perimeter calculation is crucial for this task.
Concepts Needed:

    2D Arrays (Matrices):
        Accessing and iterating over elements in a 2D array.
        Understanding how to navigate through adjacent cells (horizontally and vertically).

    Conditional Logic:
        Applying conditions to determine whether a cell contributes to the perimeter of the island.

    Counting Techniques:
        Developing a method to count the edges that contribute to the island’s perimeter.

    Problem-Solving Strategies:
        Breaking down the problem into smaller tasks, such as identifying land cells and calculating their contribution to the perimeter.

    Python Programming:
        Nested loops for iterating over grid cells.
        Conditional statements to check the status of adjacent cells.
